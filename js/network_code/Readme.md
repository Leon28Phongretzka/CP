How to use this code?
I have two ways to use this code. One from my github and another from ideone.com

With this code here:
You can download this file to your PC and run it from your terminal with Node.JS.
After download, install NodeJS here: https://nodejs.org/en
Turn on the terminal and use 'node bellman.js' command to run the code.
After that you can implement code from the example input there.

From ideone.com:
You can find this code from the below link:
